ShinyCMS TODO
=============

A list of features and functionality that I'd like to add to ShinyCMS in the 
future (short or long term).

[ Key: * is (more or less) done, + isn't finished, - isn't started ]

* Top-level / site-wide features
	- Make sure TT's |html filter is used everywhere it should be - back-end too
	- Support for multiple sites from one instance
	* Search
		+ Add search method to each controller, combine results
	* Menus
		+ Separate back-end menus out into separate templates for easier rearranging
	- Global template variables - for stuff like contact details in footer, etc
	+ Tags (for all resources - blog post, news item, gallery image, shop product, etc)

* CMS Pages
	- Sections admin UI
	- Better handling of sections - current compulsory 2-level URLs are non-ideal
	- Add confirm-delete javascript for templates and other resources
	- Make menu_position auto-adjust, so saving a low position bumps the rest up 1
	- Import Twitter feed
	- Import Friendfeed / Blogs / RSS in general
	- Full reversion history for page edits
	- Clone page
	- Screenshot of page layout on edit page, changing with template selection
	- For page add/edit, it would be nice to read in the page-element names 
		and types from the template instead of from the database
	- Per-page and/or per-section edit/admin ACLs
	- Change HTML editor to NicEdit ?
