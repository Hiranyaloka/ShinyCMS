ShinyCMS
========

ShinyCMS is an extensible CMS built in Perl using the Catalyst framework.

ShinyCMS is not a finished piece of software - a number of its features are 
either missing or incomplete - but it is ready for use in running a small 
content-managed website, and is being actively developed to add more 
features.  Please consult the documentation for more details - particularly 
docs/Features and docs/TODO.

The following functionality is currently present, in progress, or planned:

* CMS pages and forms
* User accounts, profiles and administration
* News
* Blogs
* Forums
* Polls
* Events calendar
* Image galleries
* Online shop
