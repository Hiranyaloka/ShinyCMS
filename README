ShinyCMS
========

ShinyCMS is an open source CMS built in Perl using the Catalyst framework.

It is intended for use by web designers and web developers who want to keep 
a clear distinction between the markup they create and the content their 
clients can edit.

The following functionality is either present or in progress:

* CMS pages and forms
* User accounts, profiles and administration
* News
* Blogs
* Forums
* Polls
* Events calendar
* Image galleries
* Online shop

ShinyCMS is being actively developed to add more features.  Please consult 
the documentation for more details - particularly docs/Features and docs/TODO.
