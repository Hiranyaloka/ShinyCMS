ShinyCMS
========

ShinyCMS is (or aims to be) an extensible CMS built on the Catalyst framework.

This is a pre-release piece of software.  There are many things it does not 
yet do.  Please consult the documentation for more details - particularly 
docs/Features and docs/TODO.

The aim is to include the following functionality:

* CMS pages and forms
* Image galleries
* Online shop
* News
* Blogs
* Forums
